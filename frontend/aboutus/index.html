    <p>
      Welcome to Spotted! Submit your photos! Race up the leaderboards! Complete achievements! Record all the local wildlife in your area!
      <br><br>
      The game is simple, you can submit your own sightings of any of the 288 vertabrate animals found in the UK, and using a machine learning
      algorithm, we will determine what you have Spotted. 
      <br>
      Animals will have a score based on their rarity from 1 to 50. Finding common animals won't help you get points as fast! Alongside this,
      taking pictures of groups of the same animal will greatly increase the number of points you will achieve.
      <br><br>
      You will gain even more score by completing achievements, which will also offer you the ability to change your user profile's title. By
      getting sightings of different animal families you will also unlock new profile pictures to show off!
      <br>
      The leaderboards will display the ten people with the highest number of points, with the ability to toggle to the monthly leaderboard
      which differs by only showing the most points earnt through spottings alone, not through achievements.
      <br><br>
      View the map to see where people have taken pictures and shared their own spottings!
